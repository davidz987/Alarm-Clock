# Alarm-Clock

A basic iOS application that serves as a high-function alarm clock. The alarm will go off every 20 seconds starting from the specified time for 5 minutes even if user silences it every time. The only way to turn the alarm completely off is to open the app on the device and turn it off manually. However, when attempting to turn it off, the user will be prompted with a phrase,  a block of text. Only by correctly copying the phrase, including all capitalization and spacing, will the alarm be turned off. Guaranteed to wake anybody up!
